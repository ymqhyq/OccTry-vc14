| Free disk space (complete installation) | 600 MB approx. |

On desktop, 3D viewer for optimal performance requires graphics processing unit (GPU) supporting OpenGL 3.3 or above. 
Ray tracing requires OpenGL 4.0+ or OpenGL 3.3+ with *GL_ARB_texture_buffer_object_rgb32* extension.
Textures within ray tracing will be available only when *GL_ARB_bindless_texture extension* is provided by driver.

On mobile platforms, OpenGL ES 2.0+ is required for 3D viewer (OpenGL ES 3.1+ is recommended).
The ray tracing is not yet available on mobile platforms.
Some old hardware might be unable to execute complex GLSL programs (e.g. with high number of light sources, clipping planes).

OCCT 3D Viewer, in general, supports wide range of graphics hardware - from very old to new.
Therefore, if you observe some unexpected visual issues - first check for OpenGL driver update (or firmware update in case of mobile platforms);
but beware that driver update might also come with new bugs.
Don't forget to report these bugs to vendors.

@section OCCT_OVW_SECTION_4 Installation

In most cases you need to rebuild OCCT on your platform (OS, compiler) before
using it in your project, to ensure binary compatibility.
See @ref occt_dev_guides__building for instructions on
building OCCT from sources on supported platforms.

@subsection OCCT_OVW_SECTION_4_1 Using Windows installer

On Windows Open CASCADE Technology can be installed with binaries precompiled by 
Visual C++ 2010 with installation procedure.

**Recommendation:**

If you have a previous version of OCCT installed on your station, 
and you do not plan to use it along with the new version, you might want to uninstall 
the previous version (using Control Panel, Add/Remove Programs) before 
the installation of this new version, to avoid possible problems 
(conflict of system variables, paths, etc).

**Attention:** For full installation OCCT requires approximately 650 Mb of disk space, 
but during the installation process you will need 1,2 Gb of free disk space.

OCCT installation with reference documentation requires 1,4 Gb on disk.

  * Download the OCCT installer from OPEN CASCADE web site using the link. you have been provided
  * Launch the installer and follow the instructions.

The includes and binaries of third-party libraries necessary for building and launching 
OCCT are included into binary distribution (built with Visual C++ 2010). 
When the installation is complete, you will find the directories for 3rd party products 
(some might be absent in case of custom installation) and the main **OCCT** directory:

@figure{/overview/images/overview_3rdparty.png}

The contents of the OCCT-7.3.0 directory (called further "OCCT root", or $CASROOT) are as follows:

@figure{/overview/images/overview_installation.png, "The directory tree"}

  * **adm**   This folder contains administration files, which allow rebuilding OCCT;
  * **adm/cmake**  This folder contains files of CMake building procedure;
  * **adm/msvc**  This folder contains Visual Studio projects for Visual C++ 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2017 which allow rebuilding OCCT under Windows platform in 32 and 64-bit mode;
  * **data**  This folder contains CAD files in different formats, which can be used to test the OCCT functionality;
  * **doc**  This folder contains OCCT documentation in HTML and PDF format;
  * **dox**  This folder contains sources of OCCT documentation in plain text (MarkDown) format;

@section OCCT_OVW_SECTION_4_2 Environment Variables

To run any Open CASCADE Technology application you need to set the environment variables.

### On Windows

You can define the environment variables with env.bat script located in the 
$CASROOT folder. This script accepts two arguments to be used: 
the version of Visual Studio (vc10 -- vc141) and the architecture (win32 or win64).

The additional environment settings necessary for compiling OCCT libraries and samples 
by Microsoft Visual Studio can be set using script custom.bat located in the same folder. 
You might need to edit this script to correct the paths to third-party libraries 
if they are installed on your system in a non-default location.

Script msvc.bat can be used with the same arguments for immediate launch of Visual Studio for (re)compiling OCCT.

### On Unix


  If OCCT was built by Code::Blocks, you can define the environment variables with env_cbp.sh or custom_cbp.sh script.

  If OCCT was built by Automake, you can define the environment variables with env_amk.sh or custom_amk.sh script.

The scripts are located in the OCCT root folder.

 
### Description of system variables:

  * **CASROOT** is used to define the root directory of Open CASCADE Technology;
  * **PATH** is required to define the path to OCCT binaries and 3rdparty folder;
  * **LD_LIBRARY_PATH** is required to define the path to OCCT libraries (on UNIX platforms only);
  * **MMGT_OPT** (optional) if set to 1, the memory manager performs optimizations as described below; if set to 2, 
    Intel (R) TBB optimized memory manager is used; if 0 (default), every memory block is allocated 
    in C memory heap directly (via malloc() and free() functions). 
    In the latter case, all other options starting with *MMGT*, except MMGT_CLEAR, are ignored;
  * **MMGT_CLEAR** (optional) if set to 1 (default), every allocated memory block is cleared by zeros; 
    if set to 0, memory block is returned as it is;
  * **MMGT_CELLSIZE** (optional) defines the maximal size of blocks allocated in large pools of memory. Default is 200;
  * **MMGT_NBPAGES** (optional) defines the size of memory chunks allocated for small blocks in pages 
    (operating-system dependent). Default is 10000;
  * **MMGT_THRESHOLD** (optional) defines the maximal size of blocks that are recycled internally 
    instead of being returned to the heap. Default is 40000;
  * **MMGT_MMAP** (optional) when set to 1 (default), large memory blocks are allocated using 
    memory mapping functions of the operating system; if set to 0, 
    they will be allocated in the C heap by malloc();
  * **CSF_LANGUAGE** (optional) defines default language of messages;
  * **CSF_DEBUG** (optional, Windows only): if defined then a diagnostic message is displayed in case of an exception;
  * **CSF_DEBUG_BOP** (optional): if defined then it should specify directory where diagnostic data on problems occured in Boolean operations will be saved;
  * **CSF_MDTVTexturesDirectory** defines the directory for available textures when using texture mapping;

  * **CSF_SHMessage** (optional) defines the path to the messages file for *ShapeHealing*;
  * **CSF_XSMessage** (optional) defines the path to the messages file for **STEP** and **IGES** translators;
  * **CSF_StandardDefaults**, **CSF_StandardLiteDefaults*, **CSF_XCAFDefaults**, and **CSF_PluginDefaults** define paths to directory where configuration files for OCAF persistence are located (required for open/save operations with OCAF documents);
  * **CSF_IGESDefaults** and **CSF_STEPDefaults** (optional) define paths to directory where resource files of **IGES** and **STEP** translators are located;
  * **CSF_XmlOcafResource** is required in order to set the path to **XSD** resources, which defines XML grammar.
  * **CSF_MIGRATION_TYPES** is required in order to read documents that contain old data types, such as *TDataStd_Shape*;

@section OCCT_OVW_SECTION_7 Getting Started

@subsection OCCT_OVW_SECTION_7_1 Draw Test Harness

Draw is a command interpreter based on TCL and a graphical system used for testing and demonstrating OCCT modeling libraries.

Draw can be used interactively to create, display and modify objects such as curves, surfaces and topological shapes.

@figure{/overview/images/overview_draw.png}

Scripts can be written to customize Draw and perform tests. 
New types of objects and new commands can be added using C++ programming language.

Draw contains:

  * A command interpreter based on TCL command language.
  * A 2D an 3D graphic viewer with support of operations such as zoom, pan, rotation and full-screen views.
  * An optional set of geometric commands to create and modify curves and surfaces and to use OCCT geometry algorithms.
  * A set of topological commands to create and modify BRep shapes and to use OCCT topology algorithms.
  * A set of graphic commands for view and display operations including Mesh Visualization Service.
  * A set of Application framework commands for handling of files and attributes.
  * A set of Data Exchange commands for translation of files from various formats (IGES,STEP) into OCCT shapes.
  * A set of Shape Healing commands: check of overlapping edges, approximation of a shape to BSpline, etc.  

You can add new custom test harness commands to Draw in order to test 
or demonstrate a new functionality, which you are developing.

Currently DRAW Test Harness is a single executable called *DRAWEXE*.

Commands grouped in toolkits can be loaded at run-time thereby implementing dynamically loaded plug-ins. 
Thus you can work only with the commands that suit your needs adding 
the commands dynamically without leaving the Test Harness session.

Declaration of available plug-ins is done through special resource file(s). 
The *pload* command loads the plug-in in accordance with 
the specified resource file and activates the commands implemented in the plug-in.

The whole process of using the plug-in mechanism as well as the instructions for extending Test Harness is described in the @ref occt_user_guides__test_harness.

Draw Test Harness provides an environment for OCCT automated testing system. 
Check its @ref occt_dev_guides__tests "Automated Testing System" for details.

Remarks:

* The DRAWEXE executable is delivered with the installation procedure on Windows platform only.
* To start it, launch DRAWEXE executable from Open CASCADE Technology/Draw Test Harness item of the Start\\Programs menu.
