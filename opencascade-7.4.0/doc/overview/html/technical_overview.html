<div class="textblock"><p>Open CASCADE Technology (OCCT) is an object-oriented C++ class library designed for rapid production of sophisticated domain-specific CAD/CAM/CAE applications.</p>
<p>A typical application developed using OCCT deals with two or three-dimensional (2D or 3D) geometric modeling in general-purpose or specialized Computer Aided Design (CAD) systems, manufacturing or analysis applications, simulation applications, or even illustration tools.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="technical_overview_over.png" alt="technical_overview_over.png"/>
</div>
<p>OCCT library is designed to be truly modular and extensible, providing C++ classes for:</p><ul>
<li>Basic data structures (geometric modeling, visualization, interactive selection and application specific services);</li>
<li>Modeling algorithms;</li>
<li>Working with mesh (faceted) data;</li>
<li>Data interoperability with neutral formats (IGES, STEP);</li>
</ul>
<p>The C++ classes and other types are grouped into packages. Packages are organized into toolkits (libraries), to which you can link your application. Finally, toolkits are grouped into seven modules.</p>
<p>This modular structure is illustrated in the diagram below.</p>

Modeling Data</h1>
<p><b>Modeling Data</b> supplies data structures to implement boundary representation (BRep) of objects in 3D. In BRep the shape is represented as an aggregation of geometry within topology. The geometry is understood as a mathematical description of a shape, e.g. as curves and surfaces (simple or canonical, Bezier, NURBS, etc). The topology is a data structure binding geometrical objects together.</p>
<p>Geometry types and utilities provide geometric data structures and services for:</p><ul>
<li>Description of points, vectors, curves and surfaces:<ul>
<li>their positioning in 3D space using axis or coordinate systems, and</li>
<li>their geometric transformation, by applying translations, rotations, symmetries, scaling transformations and combinations thereof.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Creation of parametric curves and surfaces by interpolation and approximation;</li>
<li>Algorithms of direct construction;</li>
<li>Conversion of curves and surfaces to NURBS form;</li>
<li>Computation of point coordinates on 2D and 3D curves;</li>
<li>Calculation of extrema between geometric objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Topology defines relationships between simple geometric entities. A shape, which is a basic topological entity, can be divided into components (sub-shapes):</p><ul>
<li>Vertex &ndash; a zero-dimensional shape corresponding to a point;</li>
<li>Edge &ndash; a shape corresponding to a curve and bounded by a vertex at each extremity;</li>
<li>Wire &ndash; a sequence of edges connected by their vertices;</li>
<li>Face &ndash; a part of a plane (in 2D) or a surface (in 3D) bounded by wires;</li>
<li>Shell &ndash; a collection of faces connected by edges of their wire boundaries;</li>
<li>Solid &ndash; a finite closed part of 3D space bounded by shells;</li>
<li>Compound solid &ndash; a collection of solids connected by faces of their shell boundaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Complex shapes can be defined as assemblies of simpler entities.</p>
<p>See the details in <a class="el" href="occt_user_guides__modeling_data.html">Modeling Data User's Guide</a></p>
<p>3D geometric models can be stored in OCCT native BREP format. See <a class="el" href="occt_user_guides__brep_wp.html">BREP Format Description White Paper</a> for details on the format.</p>

Modeling Algorithms</h1>
<p><b>Modeling Algorithms</b> module groups a wide range of topological and geometric algorithms used in geometric modeling. Basically, there are two groups of algorithms in Open CASCADE Technology:</p><ul>
<li>High-level modeling routines used in the real design;</li>
<li>Low-level mathematical support functions used as a groundwork for the modeling API;</li>
<li>Low-level geometric tools provide the algorithms, which:<ul>
<li>Calculate the intersection of two curves, surfaces, or a curve and a surface;</li>
<li>Project points onto 2D and 3D curves, points onto surfaces and 3D curves onto surfaces;</li>
<li>Construct lines and circles from constraints;</li>
<li>Construct free-form curves and surfaces from constraints (interpolation, approximation, skinning, gap filling, etc);</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Low-level topological tools provide the algorithms, which:<ul>
<li>Tessellate shapes;</li>
<li>Check correct definition of shapes;</li>
<li>Determine the local and global properties of shapes (derivatives, mass-inertia properties, etc);</li>
<li>Perform affine transformations;</li>
<li>Find planes in which edges are located;</li>
<li>Convert shapes to NURBS geometry;</li>
<li>Sew connected topologies (shells and wires) from separate topological elements (faces and edges).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Top-level API provides the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Construction of Primitives:<ul>
<li>Boxes;</li>
<li>Prisms;</li>

<li>Pipes &ndash; general-form sweeps;</li>
<li>Lofting.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="OCCT_TOVW_SECTION_4a"></a>
Mesh</h1>
<p><b>Mesh</b> module provides the functionality to work with tessellated representations of objects in form of triangular facets. This module contains:</p><ul>
<li>data structures to store surface mesh data associated to shapes and basic algorithms to handle them;</li>
<li>data structures and algorithms to a build triangular surface mesh from <em>BRep</em> objects (shapes);</li>
<li>tools for displaying meshes with associated pre- and post-processor data (scalars or vectors).</li>
</ul>
<p>Open CASCADE Technology includes two mesh converters:</p><ul>
<li>VRML converter translates Open CASCADE shapes to VRML 1.0 files (Virtual Reality Modeling Language). Two representation modes are possible: shaded, which presents shapes as sets of triangles computed by the mesh algorithm, or wireframe, which presents shapes as sets of curves.</li>
<li>STL converter translates Open CASCADE shapes to STL files. STL (STtereoLithography) format is widely used for rapid prototyping (3D printing).</li>
</ul>
<p>Open CASCADE SAS also offers Advanced Mesh Products:</p><ul>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="OCCT_TOVW_SECTION_5"></a>
Visualization</h1>
<p><b>Visualization</b> module provides ready-to-use algorithms to create graphic presentations from various objects: shapes, meshes, etc.</p>
<p>In Open CASCADE Technology visualization is based on the separation of CAD data and its graphical presentation. The presentations can be customized to take the specificity of your application into account.</p>
<p>The module also supports a fast and powerful interactive selection mechanism.</p>
<p>The view facilities provided by OCCT range from low-level tools working with basic geometry and topology (such as NURBS visualization with control points and nodes, rendering of isolines to estimate speed and quality of parameterization, or rendering of a parametric profile of edges) to high-level tools for real time quality rendering of models using ray tracing: shades, reflections, transparency, anti-aliasing, etc.</p>
<p>Here are just a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Camera-driven view projection and orientation. It is possible to choose between perspective, orthographic and stereographic projection.</li>
<li>Real-time ray tracing technique using recursive Whitted's algorithm and Bounded Volume Hierarchy effective optimization structure.</li>
</ul>
<div class="image">

<ul>
<li>Support of standard and custom materials, defined by transparency, diffuse, ambient and specular reflection and refraction index. The latter allows implementing transparent materials, such as glass, diamond and water.</li>
</ul>
<div class="image">
<img src="0012.png" alt="0012.png"/>
<div class="caption">
Simulation of a glass cover</div></div>
<ul>
<li>Optimization of rendering performance through the algorithms of:<ul>
<li>View frustum culling, which skips the presentation outside camera at the rendering stage and</li>
<li>Back face culling, which reduces the rendered number of triangles and eliminates artifacts at shape boundaries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Definition of clipping planes through the plane equation coefficients. Ability to define visual attributes for cross-section at the level or individual clipping planes. In the image below different parts of the rocket are clipped with different planes and hatched.</li>
<li>Possibility to flexibly adjust appearance of dimensions in a 3D view. The 3D text object represents a given text string as a true 3D object in the model space.</li>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="OCCT_TOVW_SECTION_6"></a>
Data Exchange</h1>
<p><b>Data Exchange</b> allows developing OCCT-based applications that can interact with other CAD systems by writing and reading CAD models to and from external data. The exchanges run smoothly regardless of the quality of external data or requirements to its internal representation, for example, to the data types, accepted geometric inaccuracies, etc.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="0014.png" alt="0014.png"/>
<div class="caption">
Shape imported from STEP</div></div>
<p> <b>Data Exchange</b> is organized in a modular way as a set of interfaces that comply with various CAD formats: IGES, STEP, STL, VRML, etc. The interfaces allow software based on OCCT to exchange data with various CAD/PDM software packages, maintaining a good level of interoperability.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Standardized Data Exchange</b> interfaces allow querying and examining the input file, converting its contents to a CAD model and running validity checks on a fully translated shape. The following formats are currently supported.<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="occt_user_guides__step.html">STEP</a> (AP203 : Mechanical Design, this covers General 3D CAD; AP214: Automotive Design)</li>
<li><a class="el" href="occt_user_guides__iges.html">IGES</a> (up to 5.3)</li>
<li>glTF, OBJ, VRML and STL meshes.</li>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="OCCT_TOVW_SECTION_6a"></a>
Shape Healing</h1>
<p><b>Shape Healing</b> library provides algorithms to correct and adapt the geometry and topology of shapes imported to OCCT from other CAD systems.</p>
<p>Shape Healing algorithms include, but are not limited to, the following operations:</p><ul>
<li>analyze shape characteristics and, in particular, identify the shapes that do not comply with OCCT geometry and topology validity rules by analyzing geometrical objects and topology:<ul>
<li>check edge and wire consistency;</li>
<li>check edge order in a wire;</li>
<li>check the orientation of face boundaries;</li>
<li>analyze shape tolerances;</li>
<li>identify closed and open wires in a boundary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>fix incorrect or incomplete shapes:<ul>
<li>provide consistency between a 3D curve and its corresponding parametric curve;</li>
<li>repair defective wires;</li>
<li>fit the shapes to a user-defined tolerance value;</li>
<li>fill gaps between patches and edges.</li>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="OCCT_TOVW_SECTION_7"></a>
Application Framework</h1>
<p><b>Open CASCADE Application Framework</b> (OCAF) handles Application Data basing on the Application/Document paradigm. It uses an associativity engine to simplify the development of a CAD application thanks to the following ready-to-use features and services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data attributes managing the application data, which can be organized according to the development needs;</li>
<li>Data storage and persistence (open/save);</li>
<li>Possibility to modify and recompute attributes in documents. With OCAF it is easy to represent the history of modification and parametric dependencies within your model;</li>
<li>Possibility to manage multiple documents;</li>
<li>Predefined attributes common to CAD/CAM/CAE applications (e.g. to store dimensions);</li>
<li>Undo-Redo and Copy-Paste functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since OCAF handles the application structure, the only development task is the creation of application-specific data and GUIs.</p>
<p>OCAF differs from any other CAD framework in the organization of application data, as there the data structures are based on reference keys rather than on shapes. In a model, such attributes as shape data, color and material are attached to an invariant structure, which is deeper than the shapes. A shape object becomes the value of <em>Shape</em> attribute, in the same way as an integer number is the value of <em>Integer</em> attribute and a string is the value of <em>Name</em> attribute.</p>
<p>OCAF organizes and embeds these attributes in a document. OCAF documents, in their turn, are managed by an OCAF application.</p>
<p>For more details, see <a class="el" href="occt_user_guides__ocaf.html">OCAF User's Guide</a>.</p>
