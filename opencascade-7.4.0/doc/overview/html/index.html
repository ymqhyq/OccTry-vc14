Welcome</h1>
<p>Welcome to Open CASCADE Technology (OCCT), a software development platform providing services for 3D surface and solid modeling, CAD data exchange, and visualization. Most of OCCT functionality is available in the form of C++ libraries. OCCT can be best applied in development of software dealing with 3D modeling (CAD), manufacturing / measuring (CAM) or numerical simulation (CAE).</p>

<p>On desktop, 3D viewer for optimal performance requires graphics processing unit (GPU) supporting OpenGL 3.3 or above. Ray tracing requires OpenGL 4.0+ or OpenGL 3.3+ with <em>GL_ARB_texture_buffer_object_rgb32</em> extension. Textures within ray tracing will be available only when <em>GL_ARB_bindless_texture extension</em> is provided by driver.</p>
<p>On mobile platforms, OpenGL ES 2.0+ is required for 3D viewer (OpenGL ES 3.1+ is recommended). The ray tracing is not yet available on mobile platforms. Some old hardware might be unable to execute complex GLSL programs (e.g. with high number of light sources, clipping planes).</p>
<p>OCCT 3D Viewer, in general, supports wide range of graphics hardware - from very old to new. Therefore, if you observe some unexpected visual issues - first check for OpenGL driver update (or firmware update in case of mobile platforms); but beware that driver update might also come with new bugs. Don't forget to report these bugs to vendors.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="OCCT_OVW_SECTION_4"></a>
Installation</h1>
<p>In most cases you need to rebuild OCCT on your platform (OS, compiler) before using it in your project, to ensure binary compatibility. See <a class="el" href="occt_dev_guides__building.html">Building OCCT from sources</a> for instructions on building OCCT from sources on supported platforms.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="OCCT_OVW_SECTION_4_1"></a>
Using Windows installer</h2>
<p>On Windows Open CASCADE Technology can be installed with binaries precompiled by Visual C++ 2010 with installation procedure.</p>
<p><b>Recommendation:</b></p>
<p>If you have a previous version of OCCT installed on your station, and you do not plan to use it along with the new version, you might want to uninstall the previous version (using Control Panel, Add/Remove Programs) before the installation of this new version, to avoid possible problems (conflict of system variables, paths, etc).</p>
<p><b>Attention:</b> For full installation OCCT requires approximately 650 Mb of disk space, but during the installation process you will need 1,2 Gb of free disk space.</p>
<p>OCCT installation with reference documentation requires 1,4 Gb on disk.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the OCCT installer from OPEN CASCADE web site using the link. you have been provided</li>
<li>Launch the installer and follow the instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The includes and binaries of third-party libraries necessary for building and launching OCCT are included into binary distribution (built with Visual C++ 2010). When the installation is complete, you will find the directories for 3rd party products (some might be absent in case of custom installation) and the main <b>OCCT</b> directory:</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="overview_3rdparty.png" alt="overview_3rdparty.png"/>
</div>
<p>The contents of the OCCT-7.4.0 directory (called further "OCCT root", or $CASROOT) are as follows:</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="overview_installation.png" alt="overview_installation.png"/>
<div class="caption">

</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="OCCT_OVW_SECTION_4_2"></a>
Environment Variables</h1>
<p>To run any Open CASCADE Technology application you need to set the environment variables.</p>
<h3>On Windows</h3>
<p>You can define the environment variables with env.bat script located in the $CASROOT folder. This script accepts two arguments to be used: the version of Visual Studio (vc10 &ndash; vc142) and the architecture (win32 or win64).</p>
<p>The additional environment settings necessary for compiling OCCT libraries and samples by Microsoft Visual Studio can be set using script custom.bat located in the same folder. You might need to edit this script to correct the paths to third-party libraries if they are installed on your system in a non-default location.</p>
<p>Script msvc.bat can be used with the same arguments for immediate launch of Visual Studio for (re)compiling OCCT.</p>
<h3>On Unix</h3>
<p>If OCCT was built by Code::Blocks, you can define the environment variables with env_cbp.sh or custom_cbp.sh script.</p>
<p>If OCCT was built by Automake, you can define the environment variables with env_amk.sh or custom_amk.sh script.</p>
<p>The scripts are located in the OCCT root folder.</p>
<h3>Description of system variables:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>CASROOT</b> is used to define the root directory of Open CASCADE Technology;</li>
<li><b>PATH</b> is required to define the path to OCCT binaries and 3rdparty folder;</li>
<li><b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b> is required to define the path to OCCT libraries (on UNIX platforms only; <b>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</b> variable in case of macOS);</li>
<li><b>MMGT_OPT</b> (optional) if set to 1, the memory manager performs optimizations as described below; if set to 2, Intel (R) TBB optimized memory manager is used; if 0 (default), every memory block is allocated in C memory heap directly (via malloc() and free() functions). In the latter case, all other options starting with <em>MMGT</em>, except MMGT_CLEAR, are ignored;</li>
<li><b>MMGT_CLEAR</b> (optional) if set to 1 (default), every allocated memory block is cleared by zeros; if set to 0, memory block is returned as it is;</li>
<li><b>MMGT_CELLSIZE</b> (optional) defines the maximal size of blocks allocated in large pools of memory. Default is 200;</li>
<li><b>MMGT_NBPAGES</b> (optional) defines the size of memory chunks allocated for small blocks in pages (operating-system dependent). Default is 10000;</li>
<li><b>MMGT_THRESHOLD</b> (optional) defines the maximal size of blocks that are recycled internally instead of being returned to the heap. Default is 40000;</li>

<ul>
<li>A command interpreter based on TCL command language.</li>
<li>A 2D an 3D graphic viewer with support of operations such as zoom, pan, rotation and full-screen views.</li>
<li>An optional set of geometric commands to create and modify curves and surfaces and to use OCCT geometry algorithms.</li>

<li>A set of Shape Healing commands: check of overlapping edges, approximation of a shape to BSpline, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can add new custom test harness commands to <a class="elRef" doxygen="C:/builds/OCCT-740_OCCT-740/Windows-64-VC10-opt/OCCT/doc/refman/OCCT.tag:../../refman/html/" href="../../refman/html/class_draw.html">Draw</a> in order to test or demonstrate a new functionality, which you are developing.</p>
<p>Currently DRAW Test Harness is a single executable called <em>DRAWEXE</em>.</p>
<p>Commands grouped in toolkits can be loaded at run-time thereby implementing dynamically loaded plug-ins. Thus you can work only with the commands that suit your needs adding the commands dynamically without leaving the Test Harness session.</p>
<p>Declaration of available plug-ins is done through special resource file(s). The <em>pload</em> command loads the plug-in in accordance with the specified resource file and activates the commands implemented in the plug-in.</p>
<p>The whole process of using the plug-in mechanism as well as the instructions for extending Test Harness is described in the <a class="el" href="occt_user_guides__test_harness.html">Draw Test Harness</a>.</p>

<div class="image">
<img src="overview_qt.png" alt="overview_qt.png"/>
</div>
<h2>Tutorial </h2>
<p>The Qt programming tutorial teaches how to use Open CASCADE Technology services to model a 3D object. The purpose of the tutorial is not to explain all OCCT classes but to help start thinking in terms of the Open CASCADE Technology.</p>
<p>This tutorial assumes that the user has experience in using and setting up C++. From the viewpoint of programming, Open CASCADE Technology is designed to enhance user's C++ tools with high performance modeling classes, methods and functions. The combination of these resources allows creating substantial applications.</p>
